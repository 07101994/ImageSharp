# to create a new package you create a new release/tag 
# in github appveyor will build it without the -cixxx tag 
# it will then be deployable cleanly to nuget.org
# means that myget/appberyor feed will always be of the form 
# 0.0.0.0-CIxxxx so you are always on CI if you pick CI for example
# unless you remove the fee.
